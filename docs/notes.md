# Technical Notes

## Docker Problem
At first, Docker Desktop was not starting because WSL was outdated.
I fixed this problem by updating WSL and restarting Docker Desktop.

Another issue was port 3000 already in use, which I solved by stopping the local Node.js server.

## Git/GitHub Lesson
I learned how to create a clean GitHub repository and use meaningful commit messages.
I also learned how Docker helps make applications easier to run on different machines.

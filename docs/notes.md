# Technical Notes

## Docker Problem
At first, Docker Desktop was not starting because WSL was outdated.
I fixed this problem by updating WSL and restarting Docker Desktop.

Another issue was port 3000 already in use, which I solved by stopping the local Node.js server.

## Git/GitHub Lesson
I learned how to create a clean GitHub repository and use meaningful commit messages.
I also learned how Docker helps make applications easier to run on different machines.

## Assignment 3 Notes

The main challenge was deploying the project on a VPS environment.
ClawCloud had some issues with the terminal, so Back4App Containers were used instead.

After connecting the GitHub repository, the project was deployed successfully using Docker.
The application worked correctly using the provided production URL.
